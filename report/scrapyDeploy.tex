\subsection{Deployment}
The project and its spider has been deployed on a server\cite{scrapydeploy} running scrapyd \cite{scrapyd}, with the help of scrapyd-client \cite{scrapydclient}. Scrapyd is an application for deploying and running Scrapy spiders; once the service is started, the user can check its functioning with a minimal GUI at localhost:6800. Scrapyd-client, instead, is a client for Scrapyd, and allows to deploy the project in an easy way. \\
