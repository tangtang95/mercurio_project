\section{Conclusion}
Thanks to this work, now the Mercurio project has new data collections available, concerning the foreign press in the financial sector, on which in the future it will be able to perform more specific analyzes, thus opening the doors to an analysis of the stock exchange on a wider scale. Furthermore, the scripts for scraping lay the foundation for many other scripts of this type, facilitating the writing and speeding up the phase of acquiring information. The analysis work, instead, shows the critical issues of the open source coreNLP library in the analysis of the natural language that will certainly require much more knowledge in order to obtain satisfactory results.
